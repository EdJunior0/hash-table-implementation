# hash-table-implementation
A hash table is a type of data structure that is widely used to make the search procedure more agile. Thus, it is widely used not for insertion or removal, but for faster searches.

In this repo, an implementation of the hash table in the Golang language was made using the multiplication method as the hash method. Furthermore, linked queues were used to handle collisions.
